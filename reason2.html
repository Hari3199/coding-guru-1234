            The Importance of Technical Knowledge in the Modern World

        <br />
        <p>
            All throughout the last century, formal education grew in importance and scope with more and more students
            opting for higher education in the fields of medicine, engineering and maths.
            <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            Many went on to get bachelor's and master's degrees, and acquire high paying white-collar jobs.
            <br />
        </p>
        What was frowned upon was technical education, as more students saw themselves sitting in plush offices and
        doing brainwork rather than being on the field and using their skills.
        <br />
        <p>
            As a result, the field of technical education - which requires skills, strength and sometimes, physical
            labour - suffered. Blue-collar jobs were frowned upon.
            <br />
        </p>
        But now, as the world sentiment moves towards equity, more and more students are inclined towards technical
        education that imparts knowledge of practical and important jobs while promoting independent workers and
        entrepreneurs.
        <p>
            <br />
            Many international schools are now offering technical skills right from the primary level to encourage
            students to hone their skills and develop inherent talents.
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            International schools in Abu Dhabi, Mumbai, Dubai agree that technical skills are a type of hard skill since
            they are something that can be taught in a classroom. Here’s why:
        </p>
        <br />
        <h1>
            Skills Worth Acquiring
        </h1>
        <p>
            Technical education is knowledge about finer skills in life, which give an added advantage to students
            besides mainstream education.
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Skills like audio editing, video editing, voice modulation, recording, etc are interesting sets of skills
            that require a finer and more nuanced understanding.
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            These skills are usually found in students who are artistically inclined or have a softer side to their
            academic persona, allowing them to experiment and explore rather than follow the rules and stay within the
            lines.
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Students are breaking free of traditional career options like that of a doctor, lawyer, engineer, and
            instead of trying to make a break for jobs that require far more technical knowledge like sound or video
            editing.
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            For Eg: A voice artist is a special individual who has taught himself/herself a skill that is not everyone’s
            cup of tea. This is an extremely diverse field that is often looked over by others.

            The Importance of a Technical Education

        <div class="gul_para">
            <p>
                ● Technical education often involves solving real-world problems. Students in technical fields are
                exposed to various challenges that require critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This fosters an
                environment where students learn to analyze situations and develop solutions on their own.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● Technical education typically includes hands-on experiences, such as laboratory work, projects, and
                internships. These practical aspects of learning empower students to apply theoretical knowledge in a
                real-world context, promoting self-learning through experimentation and application.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● Technical education has various levels of studies and a lot of different degrees too. There are
                diploma
                levels, graduate degree levels, postgraduate degree levels, research levels, and even special industrial
                training institutes for technical education in the world.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● Many of the above mentioned educational levels offer specialized courses in various technical fields.
                This
                is to adjust to the different sides of technological development and the following economic progress.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● The standard of technical education is maintained around the world with the help of international
                level
                councils and universities. They generally deal with forming standards and norms and keeping them
                consistent.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● Technical education is one of the very few fields that can provide assured sources of income for those
                who
                have proper technical skills. These jobs pay well enough for individuals to get by in a very comfortable
                manner.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● Many students of technical education have started their own companies or small scale businesses and
                have
                managed to provide job opportunities to other educated hands as well.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● Technical education schemes do have brilliant opportunities for education, employment, and even
                internships for those who are new to the business or just want to try it out.

                Advantages of a Technical Education:-
            </h1>
            <p>
                ● Students of an international school, Singapore, Malaysia, and other big cities around the world have
                to make decisions about their careers by the end of their final year of high school.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● This seems like a very young age but usually, children know their talents and strengths by that point
                in time.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● Many students of technical education opt for jobs while others opt to attend international technical
                colleges like Caltech, MIT, etc.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● Here are some of the major advantages of early technical education.
                <br />

            <h2>
                Financial Benefits
            </h2>
            <p>
                ● Local technical school degree courses or diploma courses are not as expensive as regular four-year
                courses at colleges. This is mainly due to the shorter length of the technical courses.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● They also give students the added benefit of joining a workforce directly in their stream of choice.
                <br />
            </p>
            <h2>
                Career Advice‍
            </h2>
            <p>
                ● High schools focusing on technical education often have more career advice to offer to their students
                than schools that focus on their regular subjects in academics.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● This generally tends to include a larger amount of career advice sessions, skill development workshops,
                and their teachers being able to offer more advice to the students.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● Many high-end technical institutions have connections with higher education institutions and companies
                that perpetually require fresh faces working in their technical divisions.
                <br />
            </p>
            <h2>
                Smaller Classes‍
            </h2>
            <p>
                ● The class strengths for technical fields are much smaller. This is because the students have different
                interests and there is a wide array of courses that they can choose from.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● This automatically splits the students up into smaller groups, allowing them to pursue their favored
                subjects.
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                ● This also permits them to get adequate attention from their teachers due to the smaller classes.
