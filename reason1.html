            High school is a significant part of the education process for any student. The experience prepares them for
            university admission and various undergraduate programmes by equipping them with the tools to help them
            adapt to the world as adults. A lot of opportunities rely on a student's high school education. Therefore,
            your child needs to make the most out of their time in high school. However, high school may be a
            challenging period for some students. They may take time to understand and catch up to the other students,
            or they may fall behind .
        </p>
        <p>
            When a studentâ€™s performance gets affected, it can be detrimental to their self-esteem and overall
            development of the student. They begin to lose interest in schoolwork, become distant, or are more likely to
            face more problems, such as bullying.

        <h1>
            Why Do Students Fall Behind?
        </h1>
        <h2>
            1. Bullying
        </h2>
        <p>
            Most times, when a student is experiencing bullying, they will fall behind. Although GIIS, an International
            School,has mechanisms in place to ensure cohesive learning, some high school students still experience
            bullying. Parents and teachers know that bullying and low academic performance go hand-in-hand. Usually,
            bullied students underperform to avoid undue attention from teachers and classmates. While the stress makes
            them less active, they also maintain a low profile, hoping no one will notice them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Solution:</b> Many high school students who are experiencing bullying prefer to stay silent. They may not
            speak
            up, but they are shaken inside as it affects their social interaction, and confidence. Therefore, parents,
            teachers and schools need to come together and encourage children to have open and sincere conversations.
            Regular communication and checking in on their progress will let parents and teachers know right away if
            other students or siblings are alienating or picking on your child.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
            2. Family problems
        </h2>
        <p>
            No one can concentrate on or explore their full potential when they are stressed. The loss of a family
            member, divorce of parents, or financial instability are all causes of extreme stress in children, including
            teenagers. A student who deals with a hostile home environment is likely to lose interest in schoolwork as
            well as extra-curricular activities. It can also lead to loss of concentration, which can affect their
            overall performance. The student can feel guilty, angry, and assume they are directly responsible for the
            negative environment of the home.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Solution:</b> Parents should keep communication open with their children and provide them emotional
            support. Let
            them know struggles happen, but things will be okay. Allow your child to be part of some conversations and
            make them aware of these changes. Seek out the help of teachers and school counsellors on how to keep the
            communication channels open. Communicate lovingly and listen to their needs. When your child understands and
            feels like part of the decision-making team, it is easier for them to adapt to these changes and heal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
            3. Inadequate Rest
        </h2>
        <p>
            The learning process and participation in extracurricular activities can take a toll on a student's mind.
            The need for adequate rest cannot be stressed enough. After a hectic school day, when children get home,
            they may want to stay up late watching movies, playing video games, or talking to friends. As a result, it
            leads to loss of sleep, which is associated with loss of focus, stamina and memory and attention. Lack of
            proper sleep can also cause stress, and depression which will affect the student's overall performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Solution:</b> As a parent, maintaining strict bedtime schedules will help improve your child's sleeping
            pattern.
            You can let them know the importance of an early bedtime during school nights and ensure they abide by the
            schedule. They can have a flexible schedule over the weekend. When a student gets proper sleep, they are
            more alert, active, happier and more likely to participate in class.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>
            4. Laziness
        </h2>
        <p>
            Laziness may be one of the main reasons why students fall behind. High school assignments, projects, and
            other obligations can be overwhelming. Some students lose interest and do want to take part in these
            requirements. Although it is often in phases that a student can snap out of, some students never regain
            interest in schoolwork. The laziness and lack of interest will lead to low performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Solution:</b> When a student loses motivation, they can become lazy. They need encouragement to spark
            their
            interest. You can help your child to set goals for the school year, ask the teachers to involve them in
            various activities so that they can find what appeals to them, praise their efforts, and reward their
            achievements. When the student has your support and enjoys the learning process, they gain motivation to
            improve.
        </p>

            Here are a Few More Ways to Encourage Your Child to Improve their Performance:
        </h1>
        <br />
        <p>
            1. You can talk to the teachers to find more support. Teachers also want what's best for their students.
            Therefore, when you ask them for help, they will come up with ways to help your child maximise their
            potential.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            2. When your child is falling behind, it is beneficial to enlist the services of a tutor. One on one
            coaching may help your child to understand better.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            3. Although rewarding accomplishments may improve their performance, you can find ways to reward the
            student's achievements without breeding entitlement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            4. Talk to your child lovingly and focus on their progress. Sometimes when you want them to produce good
            results, the pressure will affect their academic performance. Congratulate them for every achievement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            A high school student can communicate their feelings. Therefore, always take some time to engage them so
            that you can understand why they are having a hard time in school. This information will give your insight
            on how to help them improve and catch up with their classmates. A school with an effective support system
            for the students will also impact your child's performance. Guidance counsellors and professional teachers
            can also help and encourage your child to achieve excellence.
